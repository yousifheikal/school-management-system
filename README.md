<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p id="description">A school management system (SMS) is a software application that helps schools to manage their day-to-day operations. SMSs typically include features for student registration, attendance tracking, academic record management, fee payment, and communication with parents.

SMSs can be used to automate many of the tasks that are typically performed manually by school administrators, teachers, and parents. This can save time and reduce errors, allowing schools to focus on more important things, such as teaching and learning.</p>
